A set of technical goals, notes, and summaries of development best practice across backend APIs, frontend web applications, geoprocessing & data analytics, database selection & maintenance, and development tools.

* JS modules, loaders, bundlers. AMD, CommonJS, Webpack
* Node JS - backend API, CommonJS - Observer pattern
* AWS & Elastic Beanstalk node.js hosting
* PythonAnywhere flask APIs
* React standards, design paradigms, & patterns
* React-DOM
* SASS
* yarn, gulp, grunt, etc.
* CI/CD with Bamboo and Azure Pipelines
* Bitbucket, GitHub, Azure DevOps
* Jira, Trello, Microsoft Boards
* Typescript standards, design paradigms, & patterns
* GeoPandas & non-Esri python development
* Python backend web APIs (Flask)
* Promises, historic patterns, async await, .then(), catching, efficiency
* Efficient APIs - acceleration with CDNS like CloudFront
* Efficient SQL implementations for spatial
* React + ArcGIS API 4 for JS
* CORS
* YAML XML JSON - benefits, negatives
* SASS concepts & design patterns
* SQL vs. NoSQL - products, benefits & negatives.

# Current build goal (link to repository to come)

React, SASS, Typescript - JS API 4 - Flask or Node.js backend API with open source Python geoprocessing - SQL backend.
